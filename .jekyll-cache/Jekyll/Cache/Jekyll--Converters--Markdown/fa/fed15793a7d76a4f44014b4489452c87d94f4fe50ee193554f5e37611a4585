I"<p>I work on two projects of the DFG-funded research unit “Crossing the Borders.” The main aim of the research unit is to examine the shared domain-general processes that drive cognitive development. One project examines parallels in segmentation of speech and action. I work on this project alongside Birgit Elsner, Isabell Wartenburger and Romy Räling. We want to examine whether the processes that underlie segmentation of speech can also support segmentation of action sequences. The second project is led by Barbara Höhle. This project examines how domain-general developmental processes (e.g. inhibitory control) can explain language and social development. To do this, we created a battery of eye-tracking tasks that aims to measure these processes throughout development.</p>
