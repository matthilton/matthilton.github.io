I"<p>I’m fascinated by early language development. While we often (quite rightly!) marvel at the speed with which children learn language, I find it equally fascinating how variable language development can be: Some toddlers are absolute chatterboxes, while others can be quiet as a mouse. So how can we explain the mechanisms underlying language development of both groups of children (chatterboxes and quiet mice)? To better understand this question, I’m looking at how shyness affects young children’s learning of word meanings. My work also aims to better understand the mechanisms underlying early language processing (e.g. speech segmentation), and how differences in development of these processes can explain individual differences in language acquisition.</p>
