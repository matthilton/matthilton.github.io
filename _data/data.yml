      details: |
        My role is split across two projects of the DFG-funded research unit "Crossing the Borders." The main aim of the research unit is to examine the shared domain-general processes that drive development in a number of domains. The first project that I work on (P2) examines parallels in segmentation of speech and action. I work on this project alongside Birgit Elsner, Isabell Wartenburger and Romy Räling. We want to examine whether the processes that underlie segmentation of the speech stream also support segmentation of action sequences. The second project that I work on (PZ) is the central project of the network, and is led by Barbara Höhle. We examine how domain-general developmental processes (e.g. inhibitory control) can explain language and social development. To do this, we created a battery of eye-tracking tasks that aims to measure these processes throughout development.
