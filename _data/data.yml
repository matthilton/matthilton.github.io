introduction:
    title: About Me

    infos:

      - details: Hello! I'm a developmental psychologist currently working as a lecturer at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. I run research projects with infants and adults using both eye-tracking and EEG methodologies, and below you can find more details about this work and resulting publications. When not working hard, I can usually be found wandering aimlessly around Aachen and the local area.

researchstatement:
    title: Research Statement

    infos:

       - details: "I'm fascinated by the cognitive processes that underlie our action and language understanding. While speech and action share many similarities in terms of structure and execution, we still have a long way to go before we can understand the relation between the cognitive processes that drive processing of these two streams of information. Taking a developmental and individual-differences approach, my research aims to disentangle and specify the mechanisms that underlie action and language processing during infancy and beyond."
